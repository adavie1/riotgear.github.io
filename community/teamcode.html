     <p>
     Open Source is at it's core, a set of values. This is the standard we hold ourselves to.
     </p>

     <p>If you want to be part of this effort and you agree with the following, <b>dive in!</b></p>
     <div style="border-radius: 25px; border: 2px solid seagreen;padding: 20px;">
       <h2>Our Goals</h2>
       <ul>
          <li>Deliver a clean, fast and excellent implementation of the Blaze CSS 2 components as Riot tags<br /></li>
          <li>Document the use of the tags well and clearly to speed your use of the code<br /></li>
          <li>Make the API, code, defaults, etc. as logical and simple as possible so <b>you write less code</b>.<br /></li>
          <li>Update dependencies, such as ChartJS reasonably regularly (there is a balance between updates and forcing changes in your code if those updates require that)<br /></li>
       </ul>
    </div>


    <h2>Keep Promises</h2>

    <p>
    Open Source is a community effort. We firmly believe in software by contract. 
    This means that if we promise a feature it should work to the very best that it can. 
    It also means that in every case possible, we will be backwards compatible, unless there is a 
    damn good reason to break that promise. The only really good reason, in our view, is 
    to improve the service the software offers you, or take advantage of new technologies.
    </p>

    <h2>Integrity</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Acknowledge other sources and licenses, accurately link to the correct information</li>
    <li>Provide as good a set of docs as we can to help the developer kick off faster</li>
    <li>If something is broken we will say so, along with an estimate of a fix, if possible.</li>
    </ul>

	<h2>Our Values</h2>
        <div>
	<small>Orginal version of this has been inspired by <a href="http://todogroup.org/opencodeofconduct/" target="_blank">Open Code of Conduct</a></small>
        </div>

<div id="code-of-conduct">
  <p>This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the <strong>RiotGear2</strong> community. 
 We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our team code to be honored.</p>

<p>Our open source community strives to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Be friendly and patient.</strong><br /></li>
  <li><strong>Be welcoming</strong>: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities without exception.<br /></li>
  <li><strong>Be considerate</strong>: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.<br /></li>
  <li><strong>Remember that we’re a world-wide community</strong>, so you might not be communicating in <i>someone else’s primary language</i>.<br /></li>
  <li><strong>Be respectful</strong>:  Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners.<br /></li>
  <li><strong>Be careful in the words that we choose</strong>: we are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Always.<br /></li>
  <li><strong>Try to understand why we disagree</strong>: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.<br /></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="definitions">What We Will Never Accept Here</h2>

<ul>
   <li>Gossiping about other members: we are here to deliver a software project<br /></li>
  <li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, age, regional discrimination, political or religious affiliation<br /></li>
  <li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, sexual preference, health, parenting, drugs, and employment<br /></li>
  <li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “<em>hug</em>” or “<em>backrub</em>”) without consent or after a request to stop<br /></li>
  <li>Threats of violence, both physical and psychological<br /></li>
  <li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, group, race, or religion<br /></li>
  <li>Sustained disruption of discussion<br /></li>
  <li>Unwelcome sexual attention, including gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour<br /></li>
  <li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others<br /></li>
  <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease<br /></li>
</ul>
	
<p>If we find our members breaking our team code repeatedly, we reserve the right to remove them from contributing.</p>
