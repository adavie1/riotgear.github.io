		Open Source is at it's core, a set of values. This is the standard we hold ourselves to.
	</p>

	<p>If you want to be part of this effort and you agree with the following, <b>dive in!</b></p>

	<h2>Keep Promises</h2>

	<p>
    Open Source is a community effort. We firmly believe in software by contract. 
    This means that if we promise a feature it should work to the very best that it can. 
    It also means that in every case possible, we will be backwards compatible, unless there is a 
    damn good reason to break that promise. The only really good reason, in our view, is 
    to improve the service the software offers you, or take advantage of new technologies.
	</p>

	<h2>Integerity</h2>

	<p>
    <ul>
    <li>Acknowledge other source and licenses, accurately link to the correct information</li>
    <li>Provide as good a set of docs as we can to help the developer kick off faster</li>
		<li>If something is broken we will say so, along with an estimate of a fix, if possible.</li>
    </ul>
	</p>

	<h2>Our Values</h2>
        <div>
	<small>Orginal version of this has been inspired by <a href="http://todogroup.org/opencodeofconduct/" target="_blank">Open Code of Conduct</a></small>
        </div>

<div id="code-of-conduct">
  <p>This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the <strong>RiotGear2</strong> community, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.</p>

<p>Our open source community strives to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Be friendly and patient.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Be welcoming</strong>: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.</li>
  <li><strong>Be considerate</strong>: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we’re a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary language.</li>
  <li><strong>Be respectful</strong>:  Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.</li>
  <li><strong>Be careful in the words that we choose</strong>: we are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable.</li>
  <li><strong>Try to understand why we disagree</strong>: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>

<p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment</li>
  <li>Deliberate misgendering. This includes deadnaming or persistently using a pronoun that does not correctly reflect a person’s gender identity. You must address people by the name they give you when not addressing them by their username or handle</li>
  <li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “<em>hug</em>” or “<em>backrub</em>”) without consent or after a request to stop</li>
  <li>Threats of violence, both physical and psychological</li>
  <li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm</li>
  <li>Deliberate intimidation</li>
  <li>Stalking or following</li>
  <li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes</li>
  <li>Sustained disruption of discussion</li>
  <li>Unwelcome sexual attention, including gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour</li>
  <li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others</li>
  <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>
  <li>Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect others from intentional abuse</li>
  <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication</li>
</ul>
