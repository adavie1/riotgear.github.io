<h2>RiotGear vs RiotGear2</h2>
<p>This site is an upgrade and a fork of the excellent RiotGear compoents. However, they are Blaze CSS v1.0 compatible. This is a fork of the orginal page and code, updated for Blaze CSS v2.
If your looking for the <b>original RiotGear</b> please head <a href="http://riotgiear.js.org">over here</a></p>
<div class="o-container o-container--small">
<p style="background-colour: 'goldenrod';"><b>Note!</b>We're still working on this site, so the site is a mishmash of old and new code! You've been warned!</p>
</div>
<h2>Ready made components</h2>
<p>
	RiotGear was built to help. Help you improve your app development speed. If we've built it already why reinvent the wheel? The components should have all the functionality the majority of people need.
</p>
<p>
	In just a few lines of code you could have an off-canvas slide in <a href="components/drawer">side-menu</a>, a set of
	<a href="components/tabs">tabs</a>, a bunch of nice <a href="components/toggle">toggles</a> and lots of others. Plus the list of components is increasing all the time.
</p>

<h2>Blaze CSS v2</h2>
<p>
	Each component relies on <a href="http://blazecss.com">Blaze CSS</a> an open source modular CSS framework. Each component in RiotGear and Blaze is modular
	so you don't need the whole of either framework to get started.
</p>
<p>
	The people behind RiotGear also built Blaze so you know the two work well together, and if you want help you'll get our world class help with either framework!
</p>

<h2>Router</h2>
<p>
	We have a really cool state based <a href="components/router">router</a>. It is totally decoupled from tags so you can interact with it outside of Riot tag code.
</p>
<p>
	RiotGear and the Router are separate so you can use the router in your existing Riot apps without installing RiotGear.
</p>
<p>
	Tags can reference the router and gain access to it meaning more than one tag can be affected by more than one state and one state can affect more than one tag.
</p>
<p>
	You can even add and remove states at any point in time making code organisation really flexible.
</p>
